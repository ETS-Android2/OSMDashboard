An OpenStreetMap dashboard for <a href="https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks">OpenTracks</a>.
It shows a selected track with start- and endpoints on a map from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> based on the <a href="https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge">Mapsforge</a> library.
The default is an online map, but offline maps are supported as well. With offline maps, there is no necessity for a mobile data plan.

The default map is provided by <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap.org</a>.

Some maps require special themes to render correctly! These need to be downloaded and configured accordingly.
